- [ ] Fix app path suggested when not launched with elevated privileges.
- [ ] Shore up the snap icon search function (e.g. it doesn't find skype)
- [ ] Explicitly set color(s) used either for highlighting rows or for spinner.
  - The spinner and highlight colors are the same in Ambiance (?) theme, so the spinner is invisible during snap refresh.
