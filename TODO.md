- [x] Fix app path suggested when not launched with elevated privileges.
- [x] Shore up the snap icon search function (e.g. it doesn't find skype)
- [x] Explicitly set color used for spinner.
  - The spinner and highlight colors are the same in Ambiance (?) theme, so the spinner is invisible during snap refresh.
- [ ] Hide disabled snaps from the installed snaps window.
