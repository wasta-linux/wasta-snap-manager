- [ ] Fix glitchy icon flashing
  - Seems that getting a given icon by name from the current theme is nondeterministic. Not sure of a solution.
- [x] Provide way to install snap directly from command line.
- [ ] Make dependency search more robust.
- [ ] Ensure that snapd is installed before installing any bases or prerequisites.
- [ ] Install package using dh-python rather than debian/install file.
- [ ] Hide disabled snaps from the installed snaps window.
