- [ ] Fix glitchy icon flashing
  - Seems that getting a given icon by name from the current theme is nondeterministic. Not sure of a solution.
- [ ] Hide disabled snaps from the installed snaps window.

### Remaining Integration Testing
 - [ ] Installed snaps are properly listed (and shown).
 - [ ] Refreshable snaps are properly listed (and selected?)
 - [ ] wasta-offline folder is properly found in all supported locations.
 - [ ] Choosing a folder properly highlights updatable snaps and properly populates the "Available" list.

 - [ ] Clicking "Settings" properly opens snap-settings.
 - [ ] Clicking "Remove..." properly opens snap-store.
 - [ ] Clicking "Update" attempts to install selected snaps sequentially.
